## File INPUT / OUTPUT
* A file is a collection of data stored on a storage device

# Uses of Files
* Files play a crucial role in programming and are used for various purposes. Some common uses of files in programming include:

1. Data Storage: Files are used to store data persistently on disk, allowing programs to save and retrieve information between executions. This includes storing user preferences, application settings, and data collected or generated by the program.

2. Input and Output: Files are used for input and output operations, allowing programs to read data from external sources (input files) and write data to external destinations (output files). This is useful for processing large datasets, interacting with users through text files, and generating reports.

3. Configuration Files: Files are used to store configuration settings and parameters for programs. Configuration files allow users to customize the behavior of applications without modifying the source code. Common formats for configuration files include JSON, YAML, XML, and INI files.

4. Data Serialization: Files are used to serialize and deserialize data structures in various formats, such as JSON, XML, CSV, and binary. Serialization allows programs to convert complex data structures (e.g., objects, lists, dictionaries) into a format that can be easily stored in a file and later reconstructed.

5. Database Operations: Files are used as storage mechanisms for databases. Databases store structured data in files on disk, enabling efficient data retrieval, querying, and manipulation. Popular database systems, such as SQLite, use files to store database tables and indexes.

6. Code Organization: Files are used to organize source code into modules and packages. In programming languages like Python, Java, and C++, source code is typically organized into multiple files, each containing classes, functions, or modules related to a specific functionality or feature.

7. Resource Management: Files are used for managing resources such as images, sounds, fonts, and other assets used by programs. Resource files are bundled with applications and accessed at runtime to provide visual and audio elements, user interface components, and other content
